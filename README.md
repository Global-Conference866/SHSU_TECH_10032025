# Prototype Demo â€“ AI Shopping Assistant
This project is a prototype/demo that demonstrates an AI-powered shopping assistant. We created the interface design in Figma and built an interactive prototype using ProtoPie. The backend is powered by a Python server, enabling real-time interaction between the client and the system. We use Protopie to issue web requests to our server, where the collected data from the client is handled and sent back.
 
The assistant uses AI and APIs to: 
Understand and remember customer preferences
Recommend items tailored to each user
Provide a seamless and personalized shopping experience
 
## Features
Prototype Design: UI/UX created in Figma
Interactive Demo: Connected with ProtoPie for dynamic interactions
Python Server: Backend for client interaction and data handling
AI-Powered Suggestions: Learns from user preferences to make personalized recommendations
API Integrations: Uses external APIs to enhance the shopping experience
 
## Tech Stack
Design: Figma, ProtoPie
Backend: Python

AI/ML: Preference tracking & recommendation system
APIs: External APIs for item search and metadata
 
 
# How It Works 
1. Users interact with the prototype UI (Figma + ProtoPie).
2. The Python server processes the requests from the client.
3. AI algorithms analyze user preferences and suggest items.
 
 
4. APIs fetch product data to provide real-time recommendations.
